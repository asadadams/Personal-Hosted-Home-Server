# Personal Hosted Home Server 

## Intro
This repository is the documentation for setting up a personal hosted home server. This self hosted home server will be built using a raspberrypi 

## Why a home server? 
Someone might ask why do you need a home server? Im creating this homeserver to hep me to manage some of my personal data which includes , music , videos and movies rather relying on cloud services to store these data . One of the main important points is also to store data when im developing.

### What services will the server provide 
This server will provide the services below (will be updating it as i move forward):
- NAS(Network Access Storage)
  Will need this service to be able to access all data I host on it whenever I connect any device to my local network

- Media Server
  Will need media server to host all my movies and videos on it.

- Ad Blocker
  This service will be used to do a network wide blocking of all ads on my network. No more annoying ads in case a TV is connected to the network to watch videos or youtube LOL

- File Manager 
  Will need a file manager to easily manage all files on it 

- Programming languages and dependencies
  Will be installing programming languages and dependencies that i can code on it when im connected on it and run scripts. Thinking of getting PHP and Node on it for the mean time . Since I mostly code in JS and PHP . Will install Python for some scripting 

- Blockchain explorer 
  Need a blockchain explorer , preferably a Bitcoin explorer so that I can explorer the blockchain. Dont know if i can do that without setting up a Bitcoin Node, which im not willing to do . We will see if it is possible
